## Work Smarter, Not Harder
> Win a cumulative total of 1,000,000 MGP from the Jumbo Cactpot.

| Estimate |
| :-- |
| `9 years, 5 months and 1 week`, on average |
| `1 week`, best possible outcome |
| `31 years, 11 months and 3 weeks`, worst possible outcome |

Note: *This assumes the purchase of 3 tickets every week and ignores the participant bonus level completely (as this varies both over time and per server).*

---

### Preparation

1. Ensure you have enough MGP to purchase three tickets.

### Strategy

1. Purchase three tickets. The numbers do not matter.
2. Claim your prize when the weekly timer resets.
3. Repeat from 1.

### Calculation

This assumes the following to be true for each ticket, ignoring participant bonus level:

| Prize | MGP | Probability |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Consolation | 200 | 88.89% |
| 4th | 2,000 | 10% |
| 3rd | 10,000 | 1% |
| 2nd | 100,000 | 0.1% |
| 1st | 1,000,000 | 0.01% |

This means that for each ticket purchased the expected win per week would be:

* `200 MGP * 88.89%`
* = `177.78 + (2,000 MGP * 10%)`
* = `377.78 + (10,000 MGP * 1%)`
* = `477.78 + (100,000 MGP * 0.1%)`
* = `577.78 + (1,000,000 MGP * 0.01%)`
* = `677.78 MGP per ticket`

Which means for three tickets, the expected win per week would be:

* `677.78 MGP * 3 tickets`
* = `2,033.34 MGP per week`

Finally, this means that it will take:

* `1,000,000 total MGP / 2,033.34 MGP per week`
* = `491.8017 weeks / 52.1429 weeks in a year`
* = `9.43 years`, rounded down

The worst possible outcome from buying three tickets in a single week would be:

* `200 MGP * 3 tickets`
* = `600 MGP per week`

If this were to happen every week, it will take:

* `1,000,000 total MGP / 600 MGP per week`
* = `1,666.667 weeks / 52.1429 weeks in a year`
* = `31.96 years`, rounded down

Naturally, the best outcome would be to claim the first place prize on the first week of playing.

## Mountains Out Of Gil-hills
> Win a cumulative total of 1,000,000 MGP from the Mini Cactpot.

| Estimate |
| :-- |
| `2 years, 6 months, 1 week and 4 days`, on average |
| `1 month and 3 days`, best possible outcome |
| `25 years, 4 months and 7 days`, worst possible outcome |

### Preparation

1. Ensure you have enough MGP to purchase three tickets.

### Strategy

1. Purchase a ticket.
2. Reveal numbers in a Y formation to give the best chance of finding a high combination.
3. Reveal the row which you feel will give the highest amount of MGP.
3. Repeat from 1.

### Calculation

This uses the probabilities provided by Jambalaya on the [official forum](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/227777-About-Mini-Cactpot-Odds?p=2880796&viewfull=1#post2880796) and ignores any aspect of skill involved:

| Value | Methods | MGP | Probability |
| -: | -: | -: | -: |
| 6 | 1 | 10,000 | 1.1905% |
| 7 | 1 | 36 | 1.1905% |
| 8 | 2 | 720 | 2.3810% |
| 9 | 3 | 360 | 3.5714% |
| 10 | 4 | 80 | 4.7619% |
| 11 | 5 | 252 | 5.9524% |
| 12 | 7 | 108 | 8.3333% |
| 13 | 7 | 72 | 8.3333% |
| 14 | 8 | 54 | 9.5238% |
| 15 | 8 | 180 | 9.5238% |
| 16 | 8 | 72 | 9.5238% |
| 17 | 7 | 180 | 8.3333% |
| 18 | 7 | 119 | 8.3333% |
| 19 | 5 | 36 | 5.9524% |
| 20 | 4 | 306 | 4.7619% |
| 21 | 3 | 1,080 | 3.5714% |
| 22 | 2 | 144 | 2.3810% |
| 23 | 1 | 1,800 | 1.1905% |
| 24 | 1 | 3,600 | 1.1905% |

This means that for a single ticket, the expected win would be:

* `10,000 MGP * 1.1905%`
* = `119.05 MGP + (36 MGP * 1.1905%)`
* = `119.48 MGP + (720 MGP * 2.3810%)`
* = `136.62 MGP + (360 MGP * 3.5714%)`
* = `149.48 MGP + (80 MGP * 4.7619%)`
* = `153.29 MGP + (252 MGP * 5.9524%)`
* = `168.29 MGP + (108 MGP * 8.3333%)`
* = `177.29 MGP + (72 MGP * 8.3333%)`
* = `183.29 MGP + (54 MGP * 9.5238%)`
* = `188.43 MGP + (180 MGP * 9.5238%)`
* = `205.57 MGP + (72MGP * 9.5238%)`
* = `212.43 MGP + (180 MGP * 8.3333%)`
* = `227.43 MGP + (119 MGP * 8.3333%)`
* = `237.35 MGP + (36 MGP * 5.9524%)`
* = `239.49 MGP + (306 MGP * 4.7619%)`
* = `254.06 MGP + (1,080 MGP * 3.5714%)`
* = `293.63 MGP + (144 MGP * 2.3810%)`
* = `296.06 MGP + (1,800 MGP * 1.1905%)`
* = `317.49 MGP + (3,600 MGP * 1.1905%)`
* = `360.35 MGP per ticket`

Which means for three tickets, the expected win per day would be:

* `360.35 MGP * 3 tickets`
* = `1,081.05 MGP per day`

Finally, this means that it will take:

* `1,000,000 total MGP / 1,081.05 MGP per day`
* = `925.0266 days / 365.25 days in a year`
* = `2.53 years`, rounded down

The best possible outcome from buying three tickets in a single day would be:

* `10,000 MGP * 3 tickets`
* = `30,000 MGP per day`

If this were to happen every day, it will take:

* `1,000,000 total MGP / 30,000 MGP per day`
* = `33.33333 days / 365.25 days in a year`
* = `0.091 years`, rounded down

The worst possible outcome from buying three tickets in a single day would be:

* `36 MGP * 3 tickets`
* = `108 MGP per day`

If this were to happen every day, it will take:

* `1,000,000 total MGP / 108 MGP per day`
* = `33.33333 days / 365.25 days in a year`
* = `25.35 years`, rounded down
