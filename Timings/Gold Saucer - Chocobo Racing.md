## Off to the Races IV
> Participate in 3,000 sanctioned chocobo races.

| Estimate |
| :-- |
| `134 Hours` |

Note: *The estimate above shows how long it would take to complete 3,000 Races with an ideal Chocobo (see Preparation below). Obviously coming at this achievement from 0 would be different as an ideal Chocobo would not already exist, but at present I do not athave reliable data on how long it takes to create the ideal Chocobo nor how many races would already be completed by this point.*

### Preparation
You'll want a Chocobo capable of entering R-300 races using the [Super Sprint build](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/53vjdw/gotta_go_fast_a_super_sprint_race_build):

1. Breed a Chocobo with one of the following: `Super Sprint`, `Increased Stamina III`, `Choco Cure III` or `Choco Reraise III` with maximum endurance and stamina at 500 and a maximum speed at 350.
2. Get to Rank 50, or close enough so that endurance and stamina can be capped at 500 and maximum speed can be capped at 350. Extra training sessions should be used to put stats into maximum speed only (see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6f32tb/better_late_than_never_chocobo_racing_guide/)).
3. Teach your Chocobo the `Super Sprint` ability, or if hereditary already, give it either `Increased Stamina III`, `Choco Cure III` or `Choco Reraise III`.

### Strategy
1. Speak to NPC to start an R-300 race in Sagoli Desert<sup>1</sup> (`3 seconds`)
2. Queue for race (`30 seconds`)
3. Map transition into race (`5 seconds`)
4. Race countdown (`3 seconds`)
5. Use `Super Sprint` immediately and get into the far left lane<sup>2</sup> (`1 minute 22 seconds`)
6. Wait until the other Chocobos finish to leave the race (`32 seconds`)
7. Map transition back to Gold Saucer (`5 seconds`)
8. Repeat from 1

### Calculation

* `160 seconds total time * 3,000 repetitions`
* = `480,000 seconds / 60 minutes / 60 hours`
* = `134 hours`, rounded up

#### Footnotes

1. Sagoli Desert is the shortest of the three courses.
2. This allows you to effectively go AFK ntil the race ends (see: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HSbxYKSLOU)).

Note: *This achievement will be unlocked whilst progressing towards Off to the Races IV ([listed above](#off-to-the-races-iv)). This makes the same assumptions as listed in the notes for that achievement.*

Note 2: *This assumes a rather lenient win rate of 80%. Whilst facing NPC opponents. It is  possible, however, to have a 100% win rate using the Super Sprint build.*

### Preparation

See Off to the Races IV ([listed above](#off-to-the-races-iv)).

### Strategy

See Off to the Races IV ([listed above](#off-to-the-races-iv)).

### Calculation

* `500 repetitions / 0.80 win rate`
* = `625 repetitions * 160 seconds total time`
* = `100,000 seconds / 60 minutes / 60 hours`
* = `28 hours`, rounded up
