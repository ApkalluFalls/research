### Preparation
1. Be a level 58 or higher Alchemist.

### Strategy
1. Craft or purchase as many `Growth Formula Zeta` (HQ) as you can.
2. Accept the Levequest `The Grave Of Hemlock Groves` from 	Eloin in Foundation.
3. Hand in 6 `Growth Formula Zeta` (HQ).
4. Repeat from 2.

### Calculation

On average `The Grave Of Hemlock Groves` awards 1,872 Gil for each of the three parts of the Levequest. This is deemed to be one of the fastest and most inexpensive methods.

For each completed Levequest:

* `1,872 Gil * 3 hand-ins`
* = `5,616 Gil per Levequest`

To get up to 20,000,000 Gil, you'll need:

* `20,000,000 Gil required / 5,616 Gil per Levequest`
* = `3,562 Levequests`, rounded up

To be allowed to complete that many Levequests:

* `3,562 Levequests / 6 allowances every 24 hours`
* = `594 days`, rounded up

As for the item:

* `3,562 Levequests * 6 items per Levequest`
* = `21,372 Growth Formula Zeta (HQ)`

Assuming on top of that that it then takes about 10 seconds to accept and complete each Levequest:

* `10 seconds per Levequest * 3,562 Levequests`
* = `35,620 seconds / 60 minutes / 60 hours`
* = `10 hours`, rounded up
